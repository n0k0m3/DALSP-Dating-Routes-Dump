    I was looking at a frame decorated with dried flowers.
        No, because it reminds me of Origami.
            It's a feeling!
                Because the glass is hard and fragile, it protects the flowers yet also hurts them.
                    We will be counting on you, owner.
                        Origami is Origami, there is no need to compare with others.  TRUE END (Zero Distance Temperature)
                        Origami is already much better than me.
