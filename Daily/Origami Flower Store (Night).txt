HAPPY END      Gift
I was looking at a frame decorated with dried flowers.
Like it because it's special... hmm, you could say that.

Catch Origami
Help Origami dress her wound!

Hold Origami's hand
Origami is working so hard, I can't stay out of it...

NORMAL END     Hard to Decide
I was looking at the tied bouquet.
Maybe I took me too long to reply, Origami's eyes began to change, so I responded with haste.
Lily
The white lily reminds me of Origami.
Pure appreciation... or perhaps mixed with some other emotion...
